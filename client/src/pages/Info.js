          <b>Visualizer Usage:</b> Each sphere represents a top song from your Spotify listening history. The <b>size</b> of the sphere is proportional to how consistently the song appears in your top tracks. The <b>color</b> and <b>location</b> are based on the songâ€™s genre. Click on a sphere to see details about the song and listen to it on Spotify.

          <b>Obscurity Rating:</b> This percentage reflects how "non-mainstream" your top tracks are. It is calculated as <b>100 minus the average popularity</b> of your top songs (Spotify rates the popularity for a song out of 100, where 100 is most popular globally). A higher obscurity rating means your favorites are less mainstream.
